> What are Device Identifiers ? 
> Think of them as similar to the VIN number of a vehicle.
> 1. UDID (Unique Device Identifier) - Apple Serial Number 
> 2. IMEI ( International Mobile Equipment Identity) Number - Unique GSM number, applicable to 
> Android and iOS as long as it is on a GSM phone
> Most Apps collect at least one of the device identifiers
> App owners collect them
> Third party ad-networks that display banner ads inside the apps collect them
> Device IDs are collected because they now uniquely identify every device and the behavior of its user

Besides this information being Personable Identifiable Information (which should be handled securely) it can also be spoofed so is not a reliable identifier.
