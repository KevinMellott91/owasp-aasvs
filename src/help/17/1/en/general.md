> *  It is possible to throw a fake GSM signal. Chris Paget demonstrated a fake GSM tower during DefCon 2010 that costed about $1500. It is called IMSI catcher. An attacker can throw up a fake ATT / T-Mobile signal a few feet away. Your phone would connect to his tower since it would have a stronger signal than the nearest cell phone tower. All data that is sent unencrypted can be read by the attacker.
