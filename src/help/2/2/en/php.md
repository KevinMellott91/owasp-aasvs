Check the following:

* Is there some prescribed set of rewriterules for the webserver (Apache/Nginx) or a .htaccess file?
* What files can be found in the webroot? Should all those files be publicly accessible?
* How is routing configured? If MVC is used, were you to add a new action, could you immediately call it via a URL?
